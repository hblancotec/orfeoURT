		The temperatures gradually decrease, as the days become shorter. Autumn is the season of harvest, the time to gather the fruits of the hard work during the springÂ and summer. It is a time of preparation. Nature prepares to rest - vegetation dies down, many animals prepare for their winter slumber. Humans would traditionally make preparations, too, stocking supplies or food, wood and getting worm clothes for the upcoming cold season.
