	<h1>Poppies on the Wheat</h1>

	<p>
	<strong>Helen Hunt Jackson</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		Along Ancona&#39;s hills the shimmering heat,<br />
		A tropic tide of air with ebb and flow<br />
		Bathes all the fields of wheat until they glow<br />
		Like flashing seas of green, which toss and beat<br />
		Around the vines. The poppies lithe and fleet<br />
		Seem running, fiery torchmen, to and fro<br />
		To mark the shore.
	</p>

	<p>
		The farmer does not know<br />
		That they are there. He walks with heavy feet,<br />
		Counting the bread and wine by autumn&#39;s gain,<br />
		But I,&mdash;I smile to think that days remain<br />
		Perhaps to me in which, though bread be sweet<br />
		No more, and red wine warm my blood in vain,<br />
		I shall be glad remembering how the fleet,<br />
		Lithe poppies ran like torchmen with the wheat.
	</p>
