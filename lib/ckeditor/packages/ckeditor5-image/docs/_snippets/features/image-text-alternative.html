On its way, a few kilometers upstream it crosses the small town of Konstancin-Jeziorna. </p>

		Konstancin-Jeziorna is both small and large at the same time. Originating from the merge of the industrial, working-class Jeziorna with a more residential, spa and healthcare-oriented Skolim√≥w-Konstancin in 1969 it is sparsely populated but takes up a large area.

	The diversity of the town is also clearly notable in its architecture. The visitor will find both interesting residential buildings like this beautiful <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7BJCrPdh62tTZuyx7">villa "Caprice"&nbsp;<img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/google_maps_pin.png" alt="See on Google Maps" style="width: 12px"></a> and just as interesting industrial architecture of the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/zHkjoeDMF6PqxGBr6">old paper factory&nbsp;<img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/google_maps_pin.png" alt="See on Google Maps" style="width: 12px"></a>, now revitalized as a shopping centre.
